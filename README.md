### Need for the Project:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Health is the most critical aspect of our lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened awareness of its importance. In such a context, missing medicine schedules can significantly impact an individual's health. This project aims to address this concern. The primary feature is its multi-user capability, enabling all family members, especially elders who typically don't use smartphones, to benefit by saving their schedules on a single family smartphone.





### Key Features :
1. #### **Offline Advantage** : As the Application works with an offline database which is stored in the device, no internet connection is required, offline storage of database helps in faster read write operations.
2. #### **Multiple Users** : Medicine timings of multiple users can be stored in the same app in same smartphone.
3. #### **Medicine Quantity** : Quantities of medicine can also be stored so that one can know, how many tablets or medicines he/she has to take.
4. #### **User Friendly UI** : The user interface is made using dynamically updating RecyclerViews, which gets updated as we made changes in database.
